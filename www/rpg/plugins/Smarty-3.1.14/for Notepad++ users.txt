in order to highlight SMARTY code in Notepad++,
you have to use a xml dedicated file, called 'userDefineLang.xml'. 


open explorer at %APPDATA%\notepad++


- If it exist, it is in the Notepad++ folder
  you will have to append the xml for smarty to the file

- If it doesn't exist
  just rename the xml smarty file
  from userDefineLang_smarty.xml to userDefineLang.xml
  and place it in the folder
